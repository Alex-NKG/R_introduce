This a R learning project

# R Studio
+ Open up “Tools > Global Options. . . > General” and
  + Under Workspace,
    +  Uncheck “Restore .RData into workspace at startup”. 
    +  Change “Save workspace to .RData on exit” to “Never”.
  + Other Options
    +  Code - Editing - turn on soft wrap 
    + Appearance - Change Font Size 
    + Appearance - Pane Layout - I prefer to have Source on the top left with Console on the top Right with Environment on the bottom left where I can shrink it when not needed.
    +  Note, you won’t see a “source” pane in RStudio (top left) unless you have an R Markdown document open.

+ Installing R Markdown
  + install.packages("rmarkdown")
  + install.packages("tinytex")
  + tinytex::install_tinytex()
